urn:cite2:hmt:lsj.markdown:n92017#σαν# [Σαν ] (Greek name prob. σάν (v. `A` Σ ς B. 2), eighteenth letter in the Etruscan abecedaria ( *IG* 14.2420) and probably in the oldest Gr. alphabets, occupying the same serial position as the Hebrew Tsade (<*>, Phoenician <*> <*> *Syria* 6.103), with which it may be identified. In many of the oldest Gr. alphabets it represents the sound **s**, for which <*> and <*> (twenty-first letter in the Etruscan abecedaria) is an alternative representation preferred in other Gr. alphabets. It is uncertain whether the letter <*> (name and serial position unknown), which represents the sound σς in *Schwyzer* 707 (Ephesus, vi B.C.), 701 *A* 17 (Erythrae, v B.C.), *SIG* 4.6 (Cyzicus, vi B.C.), 45.2, al. (Halic., v B.C.) and the third sound ( σς ?) in the name of Mesambria in **BMus.Cat.Coins Thrace** p.132, is to be identified with Μ. It is also uncertain whether the numerical symbol <*> (= 900), described by Gal. 17(1).525, which has this form in *PEleph.* 1 (iv B.C.), *PCair.Zen.* 22.5 (iii B.C.), *Rev.Phil.* 35.138 (Thessaly, iii B.C.), *Milet.* 6.39 (ii B.C.), where it forms part of a symbol for thousands, and later the forms Τ *JHS* 26.287 (Athenian tesserae of iv B.C.), 25.342 (papyri of ii B.C.), *SIG* 695.83 ( Magn. Mae., ii B.C.), *IG* 12(1).913 (Rhodes, i B.C.), <*> ib. 22.2776.11, al. (ii A.D.), and <*> (medieval Mss., called παρακύϊσμα in Sch. D.T. p.496 H.), is to be identified with either of the foregoing. The numerical symbol, in the form <*>, follows ω in an Attic abecedarium, **Bullettino dell' Inst. di corrisp. archeol.** 1867.75, and that position tallies with its numerical value, since ω = 800. The extended alphabet used by Archim. *Spir.* 11, *Aequil.* 2.3 for a diagram ends with ω <*>.
